# VLANs-and-Trunk

Created a network model displaying configuration of different types of VLANs viz. Default, Data, Management, Native and Voice VLANs and the concept of trunk. 

Result: Configured a couple switches with three different VLANs using trunking between two switches. Also, configured Voice VLAN to demo successful connection between two telephones.
